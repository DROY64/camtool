# camtool
This is the camtool app for Assetto Corsa. Its original author kaspersky authorized me to put it on Github so that we can continue to work on it.

It also has some perf improvements and a new option to select an F1 cam. See here for more information: https://www.racedepartment.com/threads/camtool-2-extension-perf-fix-and-more-features.201565. You will also find a list of ideas and fixes to do on this already great app.
